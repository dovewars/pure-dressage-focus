# Dressage Focus MVP - Realistic Implementation Plan

## Core Concept
A mobile-first dressage training app that digitizes test scoring, provides instant feedback, and uses cryptocurrency rewards to incentivize consistent training. Focus on solving real pain points for dressage riders.

## MVP Features (3-Month Build)

### 1. Digital Test Scorer
**Problem Solved**: Paper scoresheets get lost, calculations are manual, no historical tracking

**Features**:
- All USDF/USEF test templates built-in
- Movement-by-movement scoring (0-10 with half points)
- Automatic coefficient calculations
- Collective marks section
- Real-time percentage calculation
- Comments per movement
- Save and export scores as PDF

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Example test structure
{
  testId: "usdf-training-level-1",
  movements: [
    { id: 1, description: "Enter at A, halt, salute", maxScore: 10, coefficient: 1 },
    { id: 2, description: "Track left at C", maxScore: 10, coefficient: 1 },
    // ... more movements
  ],
  collectiveMarks: [
    { id: "gaits", description: "Gaits", coefficient: 1 },
    { id: "impulsion", description: "Impulsion", coefficient: 1 },
    { id: "submission", description: "Submission", coefficient: 2 },
    { id: "rider", description: "Rider Position", coefficient: 1 }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Training Mode
